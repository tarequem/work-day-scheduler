# About
* This page was programmed with the intent of having the user plan their daily work schedule. On the top of the page the user can see today's date. As the work day progresses, the website will colour code which hour is present, which hours have passed, and which hours are coming up. The user can input text of what their schedule is. when users click the save button for each input field, they will see that their written plans will persist.
